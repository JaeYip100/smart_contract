# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```

## Commands:

```bash
# Terminal 1:
npm run node # Run local hardhat server

# Terminal 2:
npm run deploy # Deploy contracts using deploy.js script
```
